I am a dedicated history educator passionate about making the past meaningful for today's students. Through inquiry-based learning and critical analysis, I help students develop the skills to understand how historical forces shape our world.

My approach centers on engaging students with primary sources, fostering thoughtful discussion, and connecting historical events to contemporary issues. I believe history education should empower students to become informed, critical thinkers.
